<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p class="abstract">
    We develop ALP4AI, an Agent-based Learning Platform for Introductory Artificial Intelligence. ALP4AI is a graphical- based tool that is suitable for teaching introductory AI, places emphasis on hands-on learning, and provides for visualiza- tion of results. The tool we have developed is suitable for solving problems in both the state space search and local search problem domains. It provides for different environ- ments modeling, including, environments that contain obsta- cles or are obstacle-free, single or multi-agent, uses micro or macro states, and contains single or multi goals. Students can also conduct and report results of experiments using ALP4AI.

<h2>The ALP4AI Description</h2>
<p class="description">We provide a description of ALP4AI, our agent-based learning platform for introductory AI. ALP 4AI framework is situated in a two-dimensional grid that represents environ- ments that agents need to explore. Agents are given the task of locating goals that are randomly placed in the environ- ment. Goals represent desirable situations that agents need to achieve. Many interesting problems in introductory AI, including state space search and local search that we use to illustrate the functionalities of ALP 4AI , can be modeled to use this environment.</p>
<p class="description">ALP4AI allows for parameterization of the environ- ments. Different parameters that can be defined include, among others, provisions for single or multi-agent environ- ments, presence of single or multi-goal, and obstacle-free or obstacles-present environments. Environments are further systematically organized into states so that agents can intel- ligently navigate them. We provide two implementations for agents’ states: micro and macro states. The use of the idea of states to organize environments in ALP 4AI is fundamental to understanding basics of problems formulation in introduc- tory AI. Furthermore, the problem domains that we consider in this work require a good understanding of the concept of states and states’ successors to formulate AI problems.</p>
<p class="description">Let s be a state that represents some abstractions of the world (i.e., environment) that an agent is currently in, the successor states are defined as the possible states that the agent can transits to from s. We present our framework of the concept of a state and its successors for both the micro and macro states framework implementations.</p>
